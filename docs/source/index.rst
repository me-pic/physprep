Welcome to Physprep's documentation!
====================================

Peripheral biosignals are valuable for capturing fluctuations in cognitive and affective
states, making it possible to characterize brain-body interactions in neuroimaging setup.
The relevance of these measures when acquiring neuroimaging data and the subsequent
increase in the amount of data processing highlight the importance of establishing
reliable processing and reporting practices for biosignals acquired in magnetic resonance
(MR) context, but a standardized head-to-tail workflow has yet to be proposed.
